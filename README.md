# Instagram-User-Analytics
Project for Trainity

## INTRODUCTION
 Analyzing user interactions and engagement with the Instagram app to provide valuable insights that can help the business grow.
 Analysis involves tracking how users engage with a digital product, such as a software application or a mobile app. The insights derived from this analysis can be used by various teams within the business. For example, the marketing team might use these insights to launch a new campaign, the product team might use them to decide on new features to build, and the development team might use them to improve the overall user experience.
 The goal of this project is to use  SQL skills to extract meaningful insights from the data and findings could potentially influence the future development of one of the world's most popular social media platforms.
